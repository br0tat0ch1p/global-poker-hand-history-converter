Convert Global Poker hand histories to PokerStars format

This is a work in progress. The goal of this repo is to be able to convert Global Poker hand histories into the format used by PokerStars. This is to enable importing Global Poker hand histories into the likes of PokerTracker 4. This package is **not meant** to be used to power a HUD or to gain real time stats on other players.
